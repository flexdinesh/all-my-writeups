*All of us devs, at one point or other, would have wanted to have a personal website of our own, either to showcase our online presence or just 'coz it's fun. So here, I present you a ready-made *[*Developer Landing Page*](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page)

Usually creating a personal website would involve buying/registering a domain name, finding a free/paid hosting service, developing your site and uploading it to the hosting provider.

But with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), publishing your site is as easy as drinking a coffee.

-   You need a GitHub account (you obviously have one already)
-   Create a new repo with the name `{username}.github.io`
-   Clone the repo and create an `index.html` file
-   Add some content and `git push`

Voila! Your site should be live at `https://{username}.github.io` in seconds.

### Developer Landing Page

I wanted a Dev Landing Page to showcase everything I do online. And I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather than beautiful and hefty. So I sat down one night and created this [Dev Landing Page](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page).

Few of my friends liked it and I created the same in a few different themes for them.

And I think for most of the devs out there would like to have something similar. So if you're not looking for something fancy and like this minimal [Dev Landing Page](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page), feel free to fork/clone and customize it to your dev taste.

You can pick from one of these 9 material themes or change the colors it to suit your taste 'coz it's just too easy.

You are amazing! Have a great day! ✨
